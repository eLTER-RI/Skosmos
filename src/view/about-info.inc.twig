      <h4>About</h4>
      <p>LTER-Europe was launched in 2003 as the umbrella network for Long-Term Ecosystem Research (LTER) in Europe. The network aims at identifying drivers of ecosystem change across European environmental and economic gradients, and exploring relations between these drivers, responses and developmental challenges under the framework of a common research agenda. LTER-Europe was heavily involved in developing the concept of Long-Term Socio-Ecological Research (LTSER).</p>
      <p>Currently within LTER Europe, the eLTER Research Infrastructure (eLTER RI) is being developed in the framework of ESFRI (European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures) focussing, among many matters, on harmonised parameters and methods.</p>
